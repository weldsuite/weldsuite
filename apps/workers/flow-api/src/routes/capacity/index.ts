/**
 * /api/capacity: capacity: load per member and week, bookings, resource requests, member profiles.

 * Stub from the WeldFlow project-control foundation (slice G, portfolio): the prefix is
 * registered in @weldsuite/api-modules and this router is mounted in
 * ../../index.ts, so the slice only fills this file in. Rust mirrors every
 * route in rust/modules/flow/src/capacity.rs.
 *
 * Design: weldsuite-documentation, design/modules/weldflow-delivery-and-portfolio.md
 * and weldflow-project-control.md ("API surface").
